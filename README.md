Being an underrepresented person in tech, you may often times come across biases (conscious or unconscious) and discrimination in the industry. You may have to work harder in order to get accepted but people still might question your skills. According to a study, 88% women have experienced clients/colleagues address questions to male peers that should have been addressed to them.

Recruiters may unconsciously underestimate candidates on the basis of gender, race or even age even though you have the relevant experience!

If youâ€™ve ever gone through the recruitment process, you know how frustrating it can be at times. With recruiters leaving you hanging in the middle of emails to ghosted applications, we wanted to create a more open system where the candidates can track their progress and receive feedback on their shortcomings as well as a more efficient system for recruiters which can help them to avoid bias in recruitment and hire top talent irrespective of their age, race or gender.

## Setup
- `pip3 install django` (and any other missing modules)
- `python3 manage.py runserver` from root directory
- Go to http://localhost:8000 to use the application

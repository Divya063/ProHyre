            <h1>About the Job</h1>
            <p>Google aspires to be an organization that reflects the globally
                diverse audience that our products and technology serve. We
                believe that in addition to hiring the best talent, a diversity
                of perspectives, ideas and cultures leads to the creation of
                better products and services.
                <br><br>
                Google's software engineers develop the next-generation
                technologies that change how billions of users connect, explore,
                 and interact with information and one another. Our products
                  need to handle information at massive scale, and extend well
                  beyond web search. We're looking for engineers who bring
                  fresh ideas from all areas, including information retrieval,
                  distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking
                  and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, natural
                  language processing, UI design and mobile; the list goes on
                  and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you will
                  work on a specific project critical to Google’s needs with
                  opportunities to switch teams and projects as you and our
                  fast-paced business grow and evolve. We need our engineers to
                   be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic
                to take on new problems across the full-stack as we continue
                to push technology forward.
                <br><br>
                Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology's greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.
